## Install

- `npm install awsui-dark-mode` or
- `yarn add awsui-dark-mode`

## Use

Wrap the `AwsuiDarkMode` component around your application. While
`AwsuiDarkMode` does not currently use React contexts, this wrapper would most
likely be placed alongside your React context providers, such as React Router or
Redux.

```javascript
import AwsuiDarkMode from 'awsui-dark-mode';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <AwsuiDarkMode>
      <Home />
    </AwsuiDarkMode>
  );
}
```

## Props

### `disabled`

Type: `boolean` _optional_

When `true`, the dark mode is not applied at all. You may want to use this prop
to allow your users to toggle between dark and light mode.

```javascript
import AwsuiDarkMode from 'awsui-dark-mode';

export default function App() {
  const [isDarkModeDisabled] = useState(false);

  return (
    <AwsuiDarkMode disabled={isDarkModeDisabled}>
      <Home />
    </AwsuiDarkMode>
  );
}
```

### `root`

Type: `string` _optional_

When specified, the dark mode is applied to this CSS selector. You may want to
use this, for example, to theme your
[`CollectionPreferences` component](#collectionpreferences) by applying dark
mode to your `body` element.

[`awsui-theme`'s `AwsuiThemeRootSelector`](https://github.com/CharlesStover/awsui-theme#awsuithemerootselector)

```javascript
import AwsuiDarkMode from 'awsui-dark-mode';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <AwsuiDarkMode root="body">
      <Home />
    </AwsuiDarkMode>
  );
}
```

## F.A.Q.

### Customization

To apply your own theme overrides to the AWS UI dark mode, use the
[`awsui-theme`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/awsui-theme) package and mount the
`AwsuiTheme` component _inside_ `AwsuiDarkMode`.

```javascript
import AwsuiDarkMode from 'awsui-dark-mode';
import AwsuiTheme from 'awsui-theme';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <AwsuiDarkMode>
      <AwsuiTheme colorTextAccent="red">
        <Home />
      </AwsuiTheme>
    </AwsuiDarkMode>
  );
}
```

### `CollectionPreferences`

> What do I do if my `CollectionPreferences` component is still in light mode?

AWS UI mounts the `CollectionPreferences` as a child node of your `body`
element. As a result, it falls outside of the wrapper generated by the
`AwsuiDarkMode` component.

Currently, AWS UI does not offer a way to mount the `CollectionPreferences`
component anywhere other than the `body` element. To style the
`CollectionPreferences` component, you must apply your AWS UI theme to your
`body` element. To do this, set the [`root` prop](#root) prop to `"body"`.
